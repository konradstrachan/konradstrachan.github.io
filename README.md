I'm *Konrad Strachan* and I have been writing code since I was 7 years old.

Back then waiting several minutes for a game to load from a tape cassette on my [Amstrad CPC 464](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/2805/Amstrad-CPC-464/) felt like an eternity and I opted instead to pick up the programming user guide that came with the machine to see how I could create my own programs (without waiting).

This early curiosity sparked my passion for software development and technology in general. 

I love solving problems, collaborating, leading teams and writing code, especially using *modern C++* and *Golang*.

In my career thus far I have worked for a global provider of financial markets data, a Cryptocurrency market data firm as well as the leading supplier of remote control and security software. Further information about my professional experience over the last 10+ years can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konrad-strachan/).

When I'm not writing code I like to be up in the sky flying light aircraft like Piper PA-28s or Grumman AA-5Bs.

## Skills and technologies

![C++](img/cpp.png)  ![Golang](img/golang.png)  ![JavaScript](img/js.png)  ![NodeJS](img/nodejs.png)  ![Python](img/python.png)

* I have a strong passion for **Modern C++ (11/14/17)** and have spent a large number of years contributing to professional and hobby code bases

* **Golang** is a more recent interest of mine, having only used it professionally for about 6 months now. In that time it has won me over allowing for rapid development and solving of problems whilst retaining the power and performance of a strong statically typed compiled lanugage

* **JavaScript** is a wonderfully flexible language that I have used over many years both on the front end and more recently on the backend with the wonderful **NodeJS**

* Lastly but by no means leastly I have used **Python** extensively over the last ten years for everything from scripting to microservice deployment

## Platforms I have developed for
